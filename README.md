# LOL-Auto-Level-Presets-Generator
Generates Auto-Level Presets

How To:

1. Add missing champs to the list.
2. Run ```node generatePresets.js```
3. Check the resulting ```levelPresets.lua```
4. There may be some corrupted data (Kha'Zix, Kai'Sa) ==> They need to be manually made (im to lazy for a fix).
